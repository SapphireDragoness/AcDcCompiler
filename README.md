# AcDcCompiler
A simple compiler from the ac (adding calculator) language to the [dc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dc_(computer_program)) (desktop calculator) language.
## How to use this program
The program can be easily run from the executable [CompilatoreACDC.jar](https://github.com/SapphireDragoness/AcDcCompiler/blob/main/CompilatoreACDC.jar). Just feed it a text file containing a (valid) ac source file and let the program do its magic.
